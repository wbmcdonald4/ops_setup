# ops_setup
- This automates the configuration of new machines


# Steps
1. Install command line tools 
2. Install Homebrew
3. Create a folder called GitHub in your root directory
4. Clone this repo into that folder
5. Run this command to give executable permission to the script `chmod +x ./install.sh`
6. Run install.sh using the following command: `./install.sh /Users/home_dir/`

note, it will ask you for your password from time to time, so be aware (OR figure out how to give it permissions beforehand)

note, I removed the GitHub repo install script b/c you need to set up your private/public ssh key first before accessing it. See Notion for more info.
